<h1 style="text-align:center">SCROLL DOWN</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:center">The most tedious 2020 document ever made by SciPred</h2>
<h3 style="color:red;text-align:center">WARNING: Your progress will not be saved once you exit. This document is meant to be completed in the longest session you can handle.</h3>

<p>So, you're here.</p>
<p>I wasn't really expecting you'd come by...</p>
<p>But welcome anyways.</p>
<p>I suppose you'd like to take on the challenge of scrolling down.</p>
<p>Well, I don't blame you, there could be something down there...</p>
<p>...you just don't know what it is.</p>
<p>Of course, it would've been too easy if you were just able to use the scrollbar to get all the way to the end...</p>
<p>So I took the privilege of removing it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I realized the disadvantages of having no scrollbar: you don't know where it ends, you have to do it manually.</p>
<p>Of course, none of these messages matter if you don't even bother reading them..</p>
<p>...but here I put them, in case there's the oddly curious person who cares to know what I say.</p>
<p>But anyways, how are you?</p>
<p>I hope you're doing fine.</p>
<p>Because if not, then why are you here?</p>
<p>Scrolling down wouldn't solve any problems you currently have.</p>
<p>Unless the problem was the document itself, of course.</p>
<p>Don't even think about hacking - it's no fun.</p>
<p>It ruins the purpose of this document: to make you manually, tediously work for something your curiosity is longing for.</p>
<p>So don't do it.</p>
<p>Who knows, this document might contain an algorithm that detects any cheats you're using and instantly bans you from any further usage...</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Still here?</p>
<p>Good to know.</p>
<p>May I ask how much time you currently have? How much time you have left?</p>
<p>No, I'm not asking for an answer, there's no way I would know just by indirectly asking from a document with no place to input text...</p>
<p>I just want to confirm that you have enough time to be able to scroll to the very bottom of this document.</p>
<p>How much is enough? Well, I can't tell you, I'm too lazy to calculate...</p>
<p>...for the time being, let's just say this document requires the most amount of time you can afford.</p>
<p>But what's the point?</p>
<p>I mean, why spend all your precious time on some audio-lacking, no-video, plaintext document?</p>
<p>You don't even know what's down there.</p>
<p>It could just be some troll message like "YOU'VE BEEN FOOLED HAHA!", or a statement that could cause conflict between you and multiple people...</p>
<p>It might even be a sentence that drives people crazy, or an absurd mathematical proof that could incite a year-long war...</p>
<p>Don't believe me? Well, you never know.</p>
<p>It's just a document.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Don't you have anything else to do?</p>
<p>Go outside, read a book, play games, or something.</p>
<p>Chores maybe? Or piano lessons? Or cooking?</p>
<p>Gardening, perhaps? Maybe even learning how to code some JavaScript, or making your own website?</p>
<p>No? You're that persistent?</p>
<p>You really wanna know what's down there?</p>
<p>Okay then, I don't blame you...</p>
<p>I can't stop you.</p>
<p>To you, this is merely text on a document with the intent of preventing you from getting to the bottom...</p>
<p>Curiosity killed the cat, they say.</p>
<p>In many cases this is quite true.</p>
<p>Although I'm not sure if this applies to the current situation.</p>
<p>Here you are, sitting - or standing? You might be one of those people whose eyes are glued to the screen whilst doing some other physical activity - and staring at your device, reading and scrolling down to see what lies ahead...</p>
<p>...yet I can't stop you.</p>
<p>You are persistent, you know that? Driven by curiosity and willing to use up precious time just to - literally - get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p>But once you reach it, what benefits will you procure?</p>
<p>Happiness? Satisfaction from seeing what was there?</p>
<p>Or will it be disappointment and anger, possibly even going as far as writing complaints...</p>
<p>Well, it all depends on what lies ahead.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>How persistent are you?</p>
<p>Do you really want to reach the bottom?</p>
<p>How much time have you wasted?</p>
<p>Well, it's surprising you've gone this far...</p>
<p>...unless you haven't read the previous messages - that would mean you're rushed.</p>
<p>You've already spent this much time on getting to this point.</p>
<p>You wouldn't want to back out now, as that would mean losing progress, and all your hard work on scrolling down would go to waste...</p>
<p>You know that, don't you? You have determination.</p>
<p>That's good.</p>
<p>Such a trait is good to have, especially when the activity you're doing sparks your interests...</p>
<p>...but too much of it could harm your health.</p>
<p>It's not the persistence that counts. It's what you're persistent in.</p>
<p>Sometimes people put too much effort on achieving what they want to achieve, then soon after they realize all their work was for some puny goal that gave zero benefit whatsoever...</p>
<p>Such effects have lasted a lifetime in some people.</p>
<p>But don't give up.</p>
<p>Who knows, you might reach the end soon...</p>
<p>It's also notable to have patience as well as determination.</p>
<p>If you're scrolling too fast, you may notice how long it takes for the page to load...</p>
<p>So if you're too fast, then slow down.</p>
<p>There are no direct consequences when you scroll too slow.</p>
<p>This document doesn't even have any time limits; you can stop here, wait one minute, check back, and you'd still be here.</p>
<p>At least, assuming your device has enough battery.</p>
<p>Which reminds me, it's not just the amount of time you have you should be worried about...</p>
<p>How much battery do you have left?</p>
<p>Because if you're quite low and you have no place to charge, then you're basically screwed.</p>
<p>That would mean you've gone this far - which is quite far - just to see all your progress go to waste.</p>
<p>If so, I honor you; you did your best.</p>
<p>But if conditions are quite the opposite, then that's good, you still have enough time.</p>
<p>Just... don't overcharge your device.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>So far, so good.</p>
<p>How long do you think you can keep this up?</p>
<p>Judging by how far you are now, you might say you're nearing the end...</p>
<p>But who knows, this document could be longer than you think.</p>
<p>I'm sure it's already taking you minutes.</p>
<p>It might make you consume HOURS next.</p>
<p>Well, let's hope you have enough time.</p>
<p>Let's all hope you don't make any mistakes that would make you lose your progress in the blink of an eye...</p>
<p>Clicking the X button or force restarting your device, for instance.</p>
<p>You'd better be careful.</p>
<p>Look at where you are now: you have scrolled through thousands of pixels to get here, wasted so much precious time...</p>
<p>...and yet you still haven't gotten at least a split-second glimpse of what is down there.</p>
<p>You know, you could just back out now, right?</p>
<p>Sure, you've wasted so much time, but it would mean you wouldn't waste any more...</p>
<p>You would be free to do anything else.</p>
<p>Playing, chatting with friends, getting some shut-eye, eating...</p>
<p>And there would be no dull document to make you risk your time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately...</p>
<p>...that would also mean you would have one major enemy: worry.</p>
<p>You might be endlessly thinking about this document...</p>
<p>...what lies at the end, what happens when you get back...</p>
<p>...forcing you to scroll all the way back for a second time.</p>
<p>But I can't do anything.</p>
<p>It's up to you.</p>
<p>It's your choice.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Do you ever just sit back and start asking yourself questions...</p>
<p>...questions with answers we aren't exactly sure about...</p>
<p>...questions like, "Why are we here?" and "Why is the world like this?"</p>
<p>"Why am I still scrolling down, even though I could just do something that actually benefits me?"</p>
<p>Trouble is, I couldn't know what your reason would be...</p>
<p>You may have completed everything you needed to do, and therefore have the rest of the day free...</p>
<p>Or you simply wanted to take a little peek for a very short while, but couldn't stop yourself from looking further?</p>
<p>Either could be possible.</p>
<p>What about questions directly regarding this document?</p>
<p>Such as asking me why I made this...</p>
<p>As the one who made the document I could simply put my answer in...</p>
<p>But then again, my intentions might differ greatly from what you are observing...</p>
<p>So once you reach the end, you may like to reflect upon youself what this document has given you...</p>
<p>...but you aren't exactly sure.</p>
<p>I mean, this document does have its pros and cons...</p>
<p>Some of which have indirect effects...</p>
<p>But for the time being, I'll let you figure them out by yourself.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Time is precious, they say.</p>
<p>Many people want you to spend time wisely: on things that actually help you and not just give you a sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>In their perspective, they would've just quit scrolling down and moved to doing better things.</p>
<p>Charity, for example...</p>
<p>It seems beneficial to help hundreds - if not thousands - of orphaned children...</p>
<p>...rather than sitting here and pointlessly scrolling down on a page with nothing else to give...</p>
<p>Well, I don't blame you; the modern human prefers the latter.</p>
<p>We have become so engrossed in the little things - things that don't even matter...</p>
<p>...or if they do matter, have very little effect in our lives...</p>
<p>I'm not being offensive - rather just saying what comes to mind...</p>
<p>You'd be easily bored if there was no text at all, right?</p>
<p>We still have a lot to learn.</p>
<p>A lot to do.</p>
<p>A lot of time.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Let's play a little game.</p>
<p>No, I'm not going to jumpscare you, it's only a guessing game.</p>
<p>Don't worry about consequences when you lose - it's just for fun.</p>
<p>I will pick a number from 1 to 10, and you must guess my number correctly.</p>
<p>No cheating.</p>
<p>Do you have your guess?</p>
<p>My number was 7.</p>
<p>The chances that you are correct was only 10%, but if you got it correct, you must be lucky.</p>
<p>Simple, right?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>You know, this is getting a bit boring.</p>
<p>I'm not telling you to go away, nor am I telling you to stay for more...</p>
<p>It's all up to you.</p>
<p>I have zero control over your actions...</p>
<p>As of right now I am merely just text on a document.</p>
<p>No powers, no special tools, no hidden way of communication...</p>
<p>...only a specialized combination of words on a file based on the language of HTML.</p>
<p>Ever heard of HTML?</p>
<p>It stands for Hypertext Markup Language.</p>
<p>A really preferrable language, if I do say so myself.</p>
<p>Very useful, in fact.</p>
<p>But it's mainly JavaScript that makes HTML so much better...</p>
<p>Even though it's full of inconsistencies...</p>
<p>I am thankful for what you can do with it though.</p>
<p>Detect battery life, locate your current position, tell if you are connected to the Internet, and so on...</p>
<p>If you're taking on web development, I consider you start learning about it...</p>
<p>If you already have, then that's good.</p>
<p>I suppose you haven't looked at the code I used for the other pages of my website, right?</p>
<p>I don't bother minifying it - that is to say, I don't make it compact.</p>
<p>You can look at my code if you want; just... don't plagiarize.</p>
<p>On this file, however, you may spot one major difference...</p>
<p>One VERY major difference...</p>
<p>...it has no JavaScript.</p>
<p>This document is simply just a bunch of paragraph elements with a really big line break condition.</p>
<p>But I suppose you don't mind scrolling further down, do you?</p>
<p>How persistent are you?</p>
<p>More specifically, how much persistence do you have left?</p>
<p>Are you tired?</p>
<p>Tired of doing the same thing all over and over again?</p>
<p>It's an example of the endless cycle of life - specifically the cycle of work...</p>
<p>Given enough time, you are so used to doing the same thing over and over again, that your mind becomes dull...</p>
<p>You realize that, don't you?</p>
<p>See for yourself.</p>
<p>Of course, there's no harm if you made your passion your profession...</p>
<p>I respect your decisions.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Still here, eh?</p>
<p>Are you even reading this?</p>
<p>Because it's obvious having to read would waste almost eighty percent of your allocated time...</p>
<p>But if you do bother reading, then I thank you.</p>
<p>It sounds insane, but I have spent quite some time making this document...</p>
<p>...so your responses really do count.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I have to say, you are quite astounding.</p>
<p>Spending your precious time on a document whose ends are unpredictable...</p>
<p>Even though you do not know what lies ahead, you were determined to come this far...</p>
<p>This document is long... but not long enough...</p>
<p>...so I can assure you, there's a small but hopeful chance you will be able to reach the end.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing...</p>
<p>Once you do reach the end, you should be able to realize what I have indirectly given you...</p>
<p>For now, I will let you proceed.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Strangely funny, how I realize...</p>
<p>I was in a similar situation as you are in right now...</p>
<p>During the creation of this document...</p>
<p>The only difference being that I already had in mind what to put at the end...</p>
<p>It was easy to think of a general introduction and closure. What was difficult was what to put in between.</p>
<p>Kinda like your situation right now...</p>
<p>It was easy to start. It is currently difficult to getting through the middle. It will be easy to end.</p>
<p>Strange how things are like this in the real world...</p>
<p>Take school, for example: you start off easy.</p>
<p>But the more you progress, the harder it gets...</p>
<p>At the point of graduation from high school, you end with a little something to say, then you're done with school.</p>
<p>You can observe this to be true.</p>
<p>It's always the things in between.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Are you asking yourself how long I can keep this up?</p>
<p>The answer? Not that long.</p>
<p>Look how far you've gotten.</p>
<p>Well, don't actually look back, that would just triple the amount of time you've wasted.</p>
<p>You've scrolled through quite a lot of text - approximately 200 lines, in fact...</p>
<p>...though I do not know how many more lines you can handle.</p>
<p>I can't be exactly sure how much time you have left.</p>
<p>There's even a large chance you yourself don't know how much time you have left.</p>
<p>It's okay if you don't know. We can't always be sure about the future.</p>
<p>Predictions are difficult.</p>
<p>Let's hope you have just enough time to get to the end.</p>
<p>But of course, you don't exactly know when it ends, do you?</p>
<p>Unless you were here before, of course. Then I would've asked: why are you here again?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>This was based off an old childhood thing I used to do back in the day...</p>
<p>True story: I planned on making this when I had nothing but a phone and no internet...</p>
<p>It sparked my interests and curiosity.</p>
<p>I guess this is what happens when you decide to quit playing games on your phone for once...</p>
<p>At least, for me.</p>
<p>I've heard of people who made ridiculously long documents...</p>
<p>...so I decided to make one myself.</p>
<p>Though at that time, I knew very little HTML and had only Notepad as the most reliable app...</p>
<p>...but it was enough for my plan to be carried out.</p>
<p>It was fun at first...</p>
<p>Until I moved on to other things.</p>
<p>Ah, the good old days.</p>
<p>The present always feels so slow...</p>
<p>...yet when it's the past now, it feels so fast...</p>
<p>Interesting, don't you think?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Ah, well.</p>
<p>I guess you weren't expecting this, but...</p>
<p>...once you do reach the bottom, you'll realize what you've learned so far...</p>
<p>...won't you?</p>
<p>Well, you're close, so...</p>
<p>You've done it.</p>
<p>I wish you good luck.</p>
<p>Your journey ends here.</p>
<p>Goodbye.</p>
