<h1>???</h1>
<p>Sometime during the 20th century, a group of scientists desperately wanted to know if the universe - if reality, as a whole - was actually a simulation. Their demand for an answer had soon reached the point where they built a laboratory with the sole purpose of attempting to answer this dilemma.</p>
<p>Little by lit-le, new tools were being added to the lab, new id--s arose from the scienti-ts, new theories were for-ed about how the universe behaves if it ac-ually was a simulat-on. But as fa- as the s-ientists were concerned, they were m-king very littl- to no prog-ess.</p>
<p>Sti-l, they didn't give up on -heir quest to find an-wers. They worked a-l day, runnin- tests an- making -imulat-ons of their own to c-mpare sim-lated b-hav-or to real -uman -eha-ior. They use- some of t-e most adv-nced l-ser -echnology, m-asurin- the sp-ed of li-ht as it bounc-d back and f-rth between mil-s and -iles of d-stan-e. Years w-nt by. The scie-tists were s-arting to l-se their patienc-.</p>
<p>B-t one day it happ-ned.</p>
<p>U-ing a spec-alized pr-ssur-zer, a par-icle a-cele-ator, and a spec-al-zed AI (Sci-ncian-ba-ed, they -alle- it) to -eep tr-ck of ev--yth-ng, these sci-ntists someh-- -a-aged to compre-s a lu-p of -ron in-o a -ize much sma-le- than its -alcu-ated Schwarzschild -ad-us, with-ut it tu-ning into a -l-ck ho-e. B-t as soon as this -app-n-d, the lu-p of i-on had b-come a -tra-ge, purpl-, pul-ating bal- of lig-t that s--med to -arp time and spa-e aroun- i-.</p>
<p>The s-ienti-ts were i- awe, b-ca-se thi- -as n-w - but t-ey were a-s- in sh-ck, bec-use n-ne of th-- w--e expe-ting th-- to -ap-en. I- did-'t -it any of thei- -he-r-es. N-r did t-ey k-ow wh-- t- do -ith i-. Ho--ver, -here an- th-n t-ey -nly h-d one thi-- in t-e-r mi-d: w-s th-s fi--lly t-e -nswer to t---r qu--tion?</p>
<p>Sud-----, and w---out warning, --- ball of l---t expl---d, s---ing a shock w--- that se---d to spr--- even to the fa---est corners of the ---wn uni---se.

<p>It -as go-e.</p>
