<p>I'm not quite sure how you got here.</p>
<p>Below is an archive of forgotten stories. Mere myths. Child's play. Unimportant information.</p>
<p>There is no point in reading - or is there?</p>

<h2>The Procrastinator's Journal</h2>
<p>I wonder what to write here. Oh well.</p>
<p>Should I bother placing timestamps? They don't seem necessary, as long as I write things down in chronological order.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>There's some smoke coming from the park. Better check it out.</p>
<p>Nevermind, too lazy. I'll just eat pizza.</p>
<p>There's an explosion.</p>
<p>Fine, I'll check it out. I write what I see later.</p>
<p>Nevermind, nothing too interesting. Got kicked out anyways.</p>
<p>I hear screeching. I wonder what that is.</p>
<p>It's night time already and there's still screeching. What the heck? I can't sleep.</p>
<p>I guess I'll just read a few books with earmuffs on.</p>
<p>What's that smell?</p>

<h2>Laboratory Setup Report</h2>
<h3>Filed by Senior Scientist Jake on July 23</h3>
<p>The new laboratory took 178 days to make. We decided to place it under the local park; it's the only place crowded enough for someone to be unable to snoop around without looking foolish. The entrance will not be through the park; it will be through an underground tunnel extending up to 11 miles; its opening is in the middle of a desert. The laboratory is 30 kilometers deep relative to the surface of the park it was built under. There is heavy security, each doorway in the laboratory guarded by 15 highly trained soldiers. The laboratory itself is a 2km by 2km by 5km site, and the blueprints to build it were burnt to ashes after the construction was complete.</p>
<p>Each subject is spaced 6 meters apart from every other subject. Each of the rooms are irregular hexagons, leading to lack of tessellation. However, the main control room is an exception: it is a cuboid with ridges on the walls, and a hallway with irregularly shaped walls, sort of like a hammer with a crooked handle when viewed in the blueprints.</p>
<p>Tests will be run on the 2nd of August. Subjects from 100-A to 161-E will be transported into here, from the old and nearly abandoned laboratory in the Mediterranean. The walls have been reinforced with extremely thick steel and lead to prevent any previous instances of Subject 154-C spraying highly toxic hydrochloric acid to make an escape. Subject 156-E has been placed in an electrically-charged conduction room to prevent his ghosting abilities to allow him to escape. In the instance that a blackout happens, an antimatter backup generator keeps the room charged for approximately 1 billion years.</p>
<p>General work will begin on August 4.</p>

<h2>The Newcomer</h2>
<p>"Hi. My name is Lucius," said the man weakly, his monotone voice almost as quiet as the whooshing of the wind.</p>
<p>"You must be the newcomer. Pleasure to meet you," replied his companion, reaching his hand out for a handshake.</p>
<p>"Oh - I don't do that," reacted Lucius, a little surprised. "I've been known to be an extreme germophobe ever since I was a child."</p>
<p>"Your mother must have been proud of that attribute of yours," chuckled the man, unaware of Lucius' seriousness. "My name's Marcos."</p>
<p>Both of them sat down in a slow manner; the only thing between them was the small but noticable desk filled with papers, opened envelopes, stamps, and ballpoint pens.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lucius, I am sure you are well aware of what we do here. Otherwise you would not be here, am I correct?" inquired Marcos, his tone becoming evidently more formal.</p>
<p>"Yes. I have studied tests with previous subjects for over seven years, and I have to admit the results of your works have fascinated me," replied Lucius, his voice a little more confident.</p>
<p>"That's good," smiled Marcos, "which one were you most interested in?"</p>
<p>"I liked the Subject 132-B tests the most. Very close to unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics. I was impressed by how the scientists managed to warp time using undisturbed space. It did confuse me a little why they didn't just reconfigure the vectors to determine the fluctuations, though."</p>
<p>"Hmm. What exactly do you want to do here?"</p>
<p>"I would like to work here. I have many ideas I could suggest to improve the results of the tests on the subjects, especially those that are Class 3."</p>
<p>"Class 3! You must be aware those are the most dangerous, rookie."</p>
<p>"Well, where would the fun be without the risk?"</p>
<p>"I admire your way of thinking. I think we'll get along just fine," said Marcos, handing Lucius a few papers to sign. "Just sign right here and you'll be put in a week's probation, afterwards you'll become an official employee if you do well."</p>
<p>Lucius smiled.</p>

<h2>The Interview</h2>
<p>"What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Martha, sir."</p>
<p>"Occupation?"</p>
<p>"Senior Psychologist at Sciencia, sir."</p>
<p>"You're from Sciencia? What brings you here to New York, then? Have they decided to build another plant here?"</p>
<p>"That information I cannot disclose. However, I am here not because of business, but because of a matter of life and death."</p>
<p>"Are you in trouble?"</p>
<p>"Evidently."</p>
<p>"Why come here and not the police?"</p>
<p>"I wish to preserve my sanity. Police ask questions to which they already know the answers, which drives me mad."</p>
<p>"Okay, but how can I be sure your troubles have nothing to do with the police?"</p>
<p>"My records."</p>
<p>"We'll check them later. Do you have anyone with you?"</p>
<p>"It's just me."</p>
<p>"I see. What are you escaping from?"</p>
<p>"Mentally or physically?"</p>
<p>"The latter, if you will."</p>
<p>"I accidentally set off the trigger in the old Sciencia laboratory."</p>
<p>"The one in the Mediterranean?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it released a quarter of the subjects and now I'm the primary suspect for pulling it - which I did."</p>
<p>"Be clear with this one: why and how?"</p>
<p>"That idiot Collins fed me alcohol without my knowing. Walked in the hallways and the next thing I know I fall against the levers on the penal board. Now 30 subjects have been let loose and it's all my fault."</p>
<p>"So you wish to seek refuge here?"</p>
<p>"Assuming it's possible to even find refuge."</p>
<p>"So why go to a therapist first?"</p>
<p>"To clear my mind. I thought of it logical for someone to help me, even in the slightest."</p>
<p>"That's good. Have you ev-"</p>
<p><i>Knocking on the door.</i></p>
<p>"Oh no. They're here."</p>
<p>"Who is?"</p>
<p>"The Sciencian people. They've found me."</p>
<p>"Your associates?"</p>
<p>"They aren't anymore."</p>
<p><i>Martha opens a window, and attempts to climb through it.</i></p>
<p>"What are you doing?!"</p>
<p>"Escaping, of course!"</p>
<p>"Can't you negotiate with them or something?!"</p>
<p>"Tried and failed!"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?!</p>
<p>"I'm the suspect, of course they won't listen!"</p>
<p><i>Shouting from the other side of the door: "Open up!" followed by banging and thumping.</i></p>
<p>"This is madness!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, welcome to the Sciencian way of business."</p>
<p>"What do yo-"</p>
<p>"WATCH OUT!"</p>
<p><i>Door is busted down, followed by thick smoke.</i></p>

    <h2>The Adventurer's Journal</h2>
    <p>Today I ventured into the woods alone. Boss said I was supposed to have a team of 4 accompany me throughout the trip, but the people he picked were not worthy of the title "Explorer" - they were drunk almost all the time, weeing their pants whenever and trudging around like zombies. Filthy creatures they were, the lot!</p>
    <p>Anyways, I travelled for days, through mirky waters and narrow pathways, unsure of what I was going to find. To be honest, I wasn't exactly sure where I was headed - there were no maps or a GPS system to guide me, nor was there any sign of society ahead. All I could do was to keep walking.</p>
    <p>At one point my canteen was empty and the last remaining source of food I had were nothing but breadcrumbs. I felt like stopping to harvest berries from the trees around me - and there were few, yet more than enough - if it wasn't for the laser beam that suddenly appeared in the sky.</p>
    <p>My curiosity got the better of me. I raced to the top of the hill ahead of me to get a closer look. I thought I was near people, but what I saw instead was terrifying.</p>
    <p>There were thousands upon thousands of corpses - mostly skeletons - piled up around some strange machine in the ground. It was that particular machine that shot the laser up high into the sky. Very bright, it was! But why were there so many dead bodies?</p>
    <p>I leaned forward to get a closer look. And that was when I heard shouting from behind the machine:</p>
    <p>"How long until we turn this thing off, boss?"</p>
    <p>"Around 2 more minutes, then we can throw the bodies in the laser!"</p>
    <p>"Aye! Wanna visit Fred after this?"</p>
    <p>"It's the 6th of August, Guy! We ain't getting welcomed to that nerd today!"</p>
    <p>"Fair point!"</p>
    <p>"Let's just get this job done, innit?"</p>
    <p>Throw the bodies?! Throw the bodies into the laser?! That was the most insane thing I've ever heard in my life. These people were either war criminals or they had no care for corpses - although I fancy they might be both.</p>
    <p>I crawled over to see if I could find the two people communicating with each other - then something hit me in the head, and I blacked out.</p>
    <p>I am writing this in what seems to be a prison cell. The walls were irregular - there were 6 walls, each of different size, and a metal door with a small opening that seemed to be a window. With me in the room was a toilet, a bed with a pillow and blanket, a desk with some papers and a pencil, a lamp, and a flower pot next to the door. There was also a book titled "The Prison led by the Prisoners", but the contents were of a different language - one I could not read nor interpret.</p>
    <p>I just hope I can get out of this place. I probably did something wrong, but not against the law. At least, not that I know of.</p>
    <p>I wonder who these people are.</p>
