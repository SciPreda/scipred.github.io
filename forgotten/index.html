<p>I'm not quite sure how you got here.</p>
<p>Below is an archive of forgotten stories. Mere myths. Child's play. Unimportant information.</p>
<p>There is no point in reading - or is there?</p>

<h2>The Procrastinator's Journal</h2>
<p>I wonder what to write here. Oh well.</p>
<p>Should I bother placing timestamps? They don't seem necessary, as long as I write things down in chronological order.</p>
<p>I think.</p>
<p>There's some smoke coming from the park. Better check it out.</p>
<p>Nevermind, too lazy. I'll just eat pizza.</p>
<p>There's an explosion.</p>
<p>Fine, I'll check it out. I write what I see later.</p>
<p>Nevermind, nothing too interesting. Got kicked out anyways.</p>
<p>I hear screeching. I wonder what that is.</p>
<p>It's night time already and there's still screeching. What the heck? I can't sleep.</p>
<p>I guess I'll just read a few books with earmuffs on.</p>
<p>What's that smell?</p>

<h2>Laboratory Setup Report</h2>
<h3>Filed by Senior Scientist Jake on July 23</h3>
<p>The new laboratory took 178 days to make. We decided to place it under the local park; it's the only place crowded enough for someone to be unable to snoop around without looking foolish. The entrance will not be through the park; it will be through an underground tunnel extending up to 11 miles; its opening is in the middle of a desert. The laboratory is 30 kilometers deep relative to the surface of the park it was built under. There is heavy security, each doorway in the laboratory guarded by 15 highly trained soldiers. The laboratory itself is a 2km by 2km by 5km site, and the blueprints to build it were burnt to ashes after the construction was complete.</p>
<p>Each subject is spaced 6 meters apart from every other subject. Each of the rooms are irregular hexagons, leading to lack of tessellation. However, the main control room is an exception: it is a cuboid with ridges on the walls, and a hallway with irregularly shaped walls, sort of like a hammer with a crooked handle when viewed in the blueprints.</p>
<p>Tests will be run on the 2nd of August. Subjects from 100-A to 161-E will be transported into here, from the old and nearly abandoned laboratory in the Mediterranean. The walls have been reinforced with extremely thick steel and lead to prevent any previous instances of Subject 154-C spraying highly toxic hydrochloric acid to make an escape. Subject 156-E has been placed in an electrically-charged conduction room to prevent his ghosting abilities to allow him to escape. In the instance that a blackout happens, an antimatter backup generator keeps the room charged for approximately 1 billion years.</p>
<p>General work will begin on August 4.</p>

<h2>The Newcomer</h2>
<p>"Hi. My name is Lucius," said the man weakly, his monotone voice almost as quiet as the whooshing of the wind.</p>
<p>"You must be the newcomer. Pleasure to meet you," replied his companion, reaching his hand out for a handshake.</p>
<p>"Oh - I don't do that," reacted Lucius, a little surprised. "I've been known to be an extreme germophobe ever since I was a child."</p>
<p>"Your mother must have been proud of that attribute of yours," chuckled the man, unaware of Lucius' seriousness. "My name's Marcos."</p>
<p>Both of them sat down in a slow manner; the only thing between them was the small but noticable desk filled with papers, opened envelopes, stamps, and ballpoint pens.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lucius, I am sure you are well aware of what we do here. Otherwise you would not be here, am I correct?" inquired Marcos, his tone becoming evidently more formal.</p>
<p>"Yes. I have studied tests with previous subjects for over seven years, and I have to admit the results of your works have fascinated me," replied Lucius, his voice a little more confident.</p>
<p>"That's good," smiled Marcos, "which one were you most interested in?"</p>
<p>"I liked the Subject 132-B tests the most. Very close to unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics. I was impressed by how the scientists managed to warp time using undisturbed space. It did confuse me a little why they didn't just reconfigure the vectors to determine the fluctuations, though."</p>
<p>"Hmm. What exactly do you want to do here?"</p>
<p>"I would like to work here. I have many ideas I could suggest to improve the results of the tests on the subjects, especially those that are Class 3."</p>
<p>"Class 3! You must be aware those are the most dangerous, rookie."</p>
<p>"Well, where would the fun be without the risk?"</p>
<p>"I admire your way of thinking. I think we'll get along just fine," said Marcos, handing Lucius a few papers to sign. "Just sign right here and you'll be put in a week's probation, afterwards you'll become an official employee if you do well."</p>
<p>Lucius smiled.</p>

<h2>The Interview</h2>
<p>"What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Martha, sir."</p>
<p>"Occupation?"</p>
<p>"Senior Psychologist at Sciencia, sir."</p>
<p>"You're from Sciencia? What brings you here to New York, then? Have they decided to build another plant here?"</p>
<p>"That information I cannot disclose. However, I am here not because of business, but because of a matter of life and death."</p>
<p>"Are you in trouble?"</p>
<p>"Evidently."</p>
<p>"Why come here and not the police?"</p>
<p>"I wish to preserve my sanity. Police ask questions to which they already know the answers, which drives me mad."</p>
<p>"Okay, but how can I be sure your troubles have nothing to do with the police?"</p>
<p>"My records."</p>
<p>"We'll check them later. Do you have anyone with you?"</p>
<p>"It's just me."</p>
<p>"I see. What are you escaping from?"</p>
<p>"Mentally or physically?"</p>
<p>"The latter, if you will."</p>
<p>"I accidentally set off the trigger in the old Sciencia laboratory."</p>
<p>"The one in the Mediterranean?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it released a quarter of the subjects and now I'm the primary suspect for pulling it - which I did."</p>
<p>"Be clear with this one: why and how?"</p>
<p>"That idiot Collins fed me alcohol without my knowing. Walked in the hallways and the next thing I know I fall against the levers on the penal board. Now 30 subjects have been let loose and it's all my fault."</p>
<p>"So you wish to seek refuge here?"</p>
<p>"Assuming it's possible to even find refuge."</p>
<p>"So why go to a therapist first?"</p>
<p>"To clear my mind. I thought of it logical for someone to help me, even in the slightest."</p>
<p>"That's good. Have you ev-"</p>
<p><i>Knocking on the door.</i></p>
<p>"Oh no. They're here."</p>
<p>"Who is?"</p>
<p>"The Sciencian people. They've found me."</p>
<p>"Your associates?"</p>
<p>"They aren't anymore."</p>
<p><i>Martha opens a window, and attempts to climb through it.</i></p>
<p>"What are you doing?!"</p>
<p>"Escaping, of course!"</p>
<p>"Can't you negotiate with them or something?!"</p>
<p>"Tried and failed!"</p>
<p>"What do you mean?!</p>
<p>"I'm the suspect, of course they won't listen!"</p>
<p><i>Shouting from the other side of the door: "Open up!" followed by banging and thumping.</i></p>
<p>"This is madness!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, welcome to the Sciencian way of business."</p>
<p>"What do yo-"</p>
<p>"WATCH OUT!"</p>
<p><i>Door is busted down, followed by thick smoke.</i></p>
