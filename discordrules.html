	<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
	As a member or moderator, either temporary or permanent, you are required to follow both the Discord Terms of Service as well as the rules of this server. You are not allowed to forgo any of these conditions in any part of the server, may it be verbal, visual, or vocal. Violating any of these rules can and will result in a punishment suiting your cause, albeit your position and ranking as well as your good-willed contributions to the server and its members. You are subjected to follow these conditions for any actions you may do in the server. You may use and communicate in the server as made available to you, not as how you wish to use it nor how you believe other people have told you to use it.
	
	
	
	<h2>I. ACCOUNT</h2>
	You will be warned or kicked if you are caught having a profile picture, status, about me, user tag, nickname or banner that implies racism, nazism, fascism, fervent antisemitism, sexism, or any other form of discrimination, unless that is your actual belief (excluding forms of racism that lead to supremacism).
	<br>
	You will be warned if you are caught having a profile picture, status, about me, user tag, nickname or banner that implies NSFW or NSFL but does not explicitly show NSFW or NSFL content. (May vary.)
	<br>
	You will be kicked or banned if you are caught having a profile picture, status, about me, user tag, nickname or banner that explicitly shows NSFW or NSFL content.
	<br>
	You may be warned, kicked or banned if you are caught abusing a third-party Discord client, because it is a violation of the Discord Terms of Service.
	
	
	
	<h2>II. CONTENT</h2>
	Speak English. English is the main language in this server. If you wish to speak in vernacular, either get a translator or ask someone to assist you with translation. Be sure that the translation is accurate. (Words that violate the rules that have been mistranslated are appealable unless the words were intended.)
	<br>
	Keep stuff in their respective channels. Refer to Section III for more information.
	<br>
	No making fun of religious, suicidal or political topics.
	<br>
	No toxicity, harrassment, or discrimination of any human attribute such as race or gender.
	<br>
	Do your best not to swear. Although Carl-bot autowarns people (and when at 3 or more warns mutes them), mutes from swearing are always appealable. Just DM the owner or a staff member that can unmute you. However, note that although swear mutes are always appealable, it does not guarantee that your appeals will be granted.
	<br>
	No starting flaming arguments or debates that can get out of hand. Keep such arguments in DMs, or in other servers whenever appropriate.
	<br>
	No causing uncontrolled drama, self-pity, pessimism intended to spread to other people or existential crises. Do this privately whenever necessary.
	<br>
	Respect others as they would respect you. However, this does not mean that you should be toxic if another is being toxic at you. Your best response would be to get help from staff.
	<br>
	No blackmailing or doxxing members, regardless of the intention or what the victim did.
	<br>
	Refrain from sharing private information in the server. Things such as address, credit card information, birth certificate, driver's license, and IDs are not allowed, regardless of how heavily censored or uncensored they may be.
	<br>
	No scamming or begging, especially Free Nitro scam links. Many of these usually have a single-character error in the link. Always double-check and report scams. If you detect someone scamming people in the form of flooding channels (and sometimes DMs), immediately block them and ask help from staff. If you want to legitimately give away free Nitro, ask a staff member or give the Nitro in private. If you want to give away Nitro in a giveaway, ask a staff member to make the giveaway.
	<br>
	No spam-pinging people who have no confirmation that they are to be pinged, especially those who do not want to be disturbed. It's best if you decide not to spam-ping them in the first place.
	<br>
	No manipulating or mismanaging information. Do not try to photoshop certain messages or conversations to ruin someone's reputation or to backstab them.
	<br>
	Strictly no direct NSFW or NSFL content. This includes pornography websites, hentai, gore, psychopathic shock videos, surgery procedures and uncensored mutilation. Regardless of the intention, this server is the wrong place for that kind of content.
	<br>
	No adware, backdoors, DDoS, ransomware, bloatware, trojan horses, viruses, worms, spyware, rootkits, keyloggers, crimeware, RAM scrapers, phishing links, links to third-party driver updaters, grabify links, Visual Basic Script files, Fake Nitro rickroll links, and any other form of malware or dangerous software.
	<br>
	Strictly no posting videos, images, gifs or files that intentionally crash Discord, or files that harmfully manipulate the Discord GUI or the computers or mobile devices of those using Discord in any way.

	<h2>IV. SPAMMING</h2>
	Disallowed forms of spam include:
	<br>
	- General Spam: malvertisement, ad scams, etc.
	<br>
	- Self-Advertisement: repeatedly flooding the server with massive adverts. These include links to other channels, servers, and web pages.
	<br>
	- Ping Walls: Massive pings, usually consisting of different users.
	<br>
	Allowed forms of spam, which can be done only in the spam channel, include:
	<br>
	- Copypasta: repeatedly sending messages with the same content.
	<br>
	- Emoji Spam: mass cluttering of emojis, or using every emoji in one message.
	<br>
	- Single-Letter Alphabetical Chains: The alphabet consists of 26 different letters. The longest single-letter chain formable is 52 letters long (A-Z, A-Z), and the shortest 2 letters (A, A). You cannot form a chain not in the spam channel longer than 2n characters, where n is the number of different characters in the chain. For single-Unicode chains, the longest you can form is 10.
	<br>
	- Differing-Length Chains: These are chains with no particular order of content but are intuitively similar.
	<br>
	- Numerical Sequences: These are chains with a particular mathematical order that altogether make a sequence, such as arithmetic, geometric, harmonic, and Fibonacci sequences.
	<br>
	- Character Increments/Decrements: These are chains where a character or a group of characters is added or removed from the previous message's content.
	<br>
	- Vertical Sentences: Chains that when read from top to bottom or vice versa form a sentence, phrase, or word.
	<br>
	- Random Characters: Chains or messages without any particular order or similarity, especially those that look like you slammed your hands or feet (or sometimes your head) on your keyboard.
	<br>
	- Malbolge: A programming language specifically designed to be almost impossible to use.
	<br>
	- Blanks: these are empty-looking messages that fill up more than half of the entire screen.
	<br>
	- Text Walls: Huge chunks of text that fill the screen up. However, although allowed by default, there is a limit to which a text wall can be considered approved, depending on how many lines the wall measures by height.
	<br>
	- Predictive Text: Sentences or phrases formed from predictive text.
	
	
	
	<h2>V. MODERATION</h2>
	Do not simply ask for staff. If you are to apply for staff you will strongly need acceptable experience as well as evidence, and you will have to wait until staff applications are open. Do not repeatedly superior staff for it.
	<br>
	If you want to be promoted, DM the owner about your request. Be serious about it. Do not repeatedly ask the owner about it.
	<br>
	If you want someone else to be promoted, DM the owner about your request. Do not repeatedly ask the owner about it.
	<br>
	There is no guarantee that you (or someone you want to be promoted) will be promoted after asking the owner about it.
	<br>
	If you want to resign from staff or want to be demoted to a lower level of staff, DM the owner. However, you cannot simply ask to be demoted to trial staff, because that would cause a sort of promote-demote loop. The lowest form of staff you can ask for is normal staff. Do not repeatedly ask the owner about it.
	<br>
	Anyone caught demoting or promoting staff without the owner's consent or knowledge will be demoted and tempbanned without appeal. Anyone caught performing false mutes, warns, kicks or bans will be demoted and/or tempbanned.
	<br>
	No creating, modifying, or deleting roles, channels, invites and categories without permission from the owner. The level of moderation here is medium and has a 2FA requirement. You will be instantly demoted and permabanned without appeal if you are caught to have intentionally deleted an important server role. If accidental, you will be demoted and kicked.
	<br>
	Do not abuse your moderation abilities. Do not use them to blackmail or dox people, force people into doing something that violates the rules, ban or kick people for no good reason, assign or remove roles from people without a sufficient reason or permission, mass-ping people or roles without a sufficient reason or permission, or violate the rules yourself using your presence as a staff member as an excuse. No creating emojis that violate the rules or remove already-existing emojis that you did not create.
	<br>
	Do not mute, kick, ban, or perform any moderation commands on a person because of personal preference.
	<br>
	Be cautious for any accounts that are younger than 14 days old. If you detect any suspicious activity from the account, tempban or permaban the account immediately depending on the activities.
	<br>
	If you see someone Nitro scam raiding or racist-advertising, permaban the user without hesitation or remorse. Delete all the user has said in the server within 24 hours.
	<br>
	If someone wants to legitimately give away Nitro, use the alias "FN courtesy of" in the giveaway instead of "Free Nitro, courtesy of" to prevent an accidental mute. If the giveaway ends and the person does not confirm giving the Nitro to the winner, tempban the person for 7 days.
	<br>
	No inviting/kicking bots without sufficient permission from the owner. No modifying Carl-bot settings without sufficient permission from the owner. No banning or kicking because of personal preference. Anyone caught trying to appeal a ban without the owner's knowledge will be demoted unless the reason is legitimate and has evidence to back up the appeal. Anyone caught trying to delete evidence for a ban will be demoted.
	<br>
	Staff receive a temporary demote upon causing an infraction, with the duration of the demote dependent on the violation caused. Upon 3 or more infractions the targeted staff member is permanently demoted. Infractions are not appealable unless it is accidental, such as when swearing.
	<br>
	However, if the level of the violation caused by the staff is extreme, staff will be immediately permabanned from the server.
	<br>
	If you are caught ignoring a misbehaver and taking no actions even though you are well aware and are visibly active in the channels the person is misbehaving in, you will be warned or demoted. If you are joining the misbehaver, you will be warned and demoted.
	<br>
	If you notice any one of our staff misbehaving, report immediately to superior administration or directly to SciPred. False reports will be warned.
	
	
	
	<h2>VI. GIVEAWAYS</h2>
	No begging. If you got re-rolled, that's probably because you didn't respond in time, and we don't need your verification on if we host legit or not. If a giveaway does not have any specified response time then you should claim it as soon as possible. If you do not claim it within 3 days or so, the giveaway will be re-rolled.
	<br>
	If you have won a giveaway but the giveaway host is offline, either wait for the host to become online and DM them there and then, or DM them while they're offline and they can give the prize once they are online.
	<br>
	If the giveaway host is online and you have DM'd them but they have not given the prize, or if the giveaway host has a response time but is not online during the set response time, either wait for a response and DM them again, or complain directly to SciPred that you have been scammed. It is not suggested that you wait any longer than 24 hours upon winning the giveaway. False complaints will not be tolerated.
	<br>
	Do not erase giveaways that have already started. Wait for the giveaway to finish and for the prizes to be given, then you may delete the giveaway.
	
	
	
	<h2>VII. LOOPHOLES, BYPASSES, AND FALLACIES</h2>
	You are not allowed to use loopholes, false arguments and the like to escape a designated consequence for breaking a rule. These include:
	<br>
	- Ad Antiquitatem: "It's right because it's always been done that way."
	<br>
	- Ad Hominem: "But he's bad because he did that, so it's only right I do this."
	<br>
	- Ad Misericordiam: "But please, let me do this just once! I'm so poor and I've never done this before!"
	<br>
	- Ad Populum: "According to the majority of people, this doesn't count."
	<br>
	- Ad Verecundiam: "According to this person, who is authoritative, this doesn't count."
	<br>
	- Attribution: "If he did it in another server without getting banned then I can do it in this server."
	<br>
	- Authority: "Who do you think you are that dare talk to me like that?"
	<br>
	- Authorization: "One of your staff said I could do it."
	<br>
	- Bandwagon: "I don't see him following the rules, so I'm doing the same."
	<br>
	- Blame: "He told me to do it!"
	<br>
	- Bribery: "If you let me do so I'll give you what you want."
	<br>
	- Compensation: "You punished me for no apparent reason, so this should make up for it."
	<br>
	- Contribution: "I helped this server out a lot, so I deserve it."
	<br>
	- Equivocation: "This is a Discord server. X is a Discord server. Therefore this server and X are the same."
	<br>
	- Experimentation: "It's just a test, no harm done."
	<br>
	- False Idiocy: "I don't understand."
	<br>
	- Freedom: "What use is a server that does not grant us freedom?"
	<br>
	- Hypocrisy: "As if you yourself follow the rules."
	<br>
	- Lacuna: "There isn't any rule that specifically states that this is a violation."
	<br>
	- Memeing: "I was just joking bro"
	<br>
	- Privacy: "Clearly this is my business, not yours."
	<br>
	- Private Interpretation: "According to me, this doesn't count."
	<br>
	- Regional Placement: "In the place I'm in, this rule doesn't apply."
	<br>
	- Repetitive Accidents: "Whoops, sorry, I mistyped... whoops, I copypasted the wrong thing... whoops, autocorrect..."
	<br>
	- Revenge: "You broke the rules in my server, so I'll do the same in yours."
	<br>
	- Self-Interpretation: "In my defense, it didn't look like it was breaking the rules."
	<br>
	- Specification: "I'm pretty sure this rule only applies to this certain channel."
	<br>
	- Superiority: "I'm a staff member, I can do what I want."
	<br>
	- Time Differentiation: "You're reprimanding the me now rather than the me from earlier. You can't do that."
	<br>
	- Tu quoque: "You did that, so I can do that too!"
