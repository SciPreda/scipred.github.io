<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
As a member or moderator, either temporary or permanent, you are required to follow both the Discord Terms of Service as well as the rules of this server. You are not allowed to forgo any of these conditions in any part of the server, may it be verbal, visual, or vocal. Violating any of these rules can and will result in a punishment suiting your cause, albeit your position and ranking as well as your good-willed contributions to the server and its members. You are subjected to follow these conditions for as long as you are in the server. These rules do not apply to anywhere outside the server. You may use and communicate in the server as made available to you, not as how you wish to use it nor how you believe other people have told you to use it.



<h2>I. ACCOUNT</h2>
You will be banned if you are caught having a profile picture, status, about me page, user tag, nickname or banner that directly implies NSFW, NSFL, extreme war ideology, uncontrolled trolling or racism.
<br>
You may either be kicked or banned if you are impersonating SciPred - not directly from the user profile, but from the actions you present in this server as well as outside the server.
<br>
You may also be kicked or banned for impersonating other known people, depending on the actions you present in this server.



<h2>II. CONTENT</h2>
Speak English as much as possible. English is the main language in this server.
<br>
Spam must only be sent in the designated spam channel, advertisement in the advertisement channel, and so on.
<br>
No making fun of religious, life-threatening or political topics.
<br>
No toxicity, harrassment, or racism.
<br>
No starting flaming arguments.
<br>
No trying to spark debates that can get out of hand.
<br>
No causing drama, self-pity, intended pessimism, existential crises, or false optimism.
<br>
Respect each and every one's principles, philosophies, conditions, religion, and race.
<br>
No blackmailing or doxxing.
<br>
Refrain from sharing private information with others.
<br>
No scamming or begging.
<br>
No spam-pinging people.
<br>
No manipulating or mismanaging information.
<br>
No trojan horses, worms, viruses, IP address grabbers, NSFW or NSFL content, bloatware, and any other form of malware.
<br>
No posting videos, images, gifs or files that intentionally crash Discord.
<br>
No posting files that harmfully manipulate the Discord GUI in any way.
<br>
No posting files that harmfully manipulate the computers or mobile devices of those using Discord in any way.



<h2>III. SPAMMING</h2>
Spam may only be done in the spam channel. Any spam caught outside the designated channel may result in a mute, including:
<br>
- Copypasta: repeatedly sending messages with the same content.
<br>
- Self-Advertisement: repeatedly flooding the server with massive adverts. These include links to other channels, servers, and web pages.
<br>
- Emoji Spam: mass cluttering of emojis.
<br>
- Single-Letter Alphabetical Chains: The alphabet consists of 26 different letters. The longest single-letter chain formable is 52 letters long (A-Z, A-Z), and the shortest 2 letters (A, A). You cannot form a chain not in the spam channel longer than 2n characters, where n is the number of different characters in the chain. For single-Unicode chains, the longest you can form is 10.
<br>
- Differing-Length Chains: These are chains with no particular order of content but are intuitively similar.
<br>
- Numerical Sequences: These are chains with a particular mathematical order that altogether make a sequence, such as arithmetic, geometric, harmonic, and Fibonacci sequences.
<br>
- Character Increments/Decrements: These are chains where a character or a group of characters is added or removed from the previous message's content.
<br>
- Vertical Sentences: Chains that when read from top to bottom or vice versa form a sentence, phrase, or word.
<br>
- Random Characters: Chains or messages without any particular order or similarity, especially those that look like you slammed your hands on your keyboard.
<br>
- Malbolge: A programming language specifically designed to be almost impossible to use.
<br>
- PGP or Salt Packets: encrypted data only few people use.
<br>
- Blanks: these are empty-looking messages that fill up more than half of the entire screen.
<br>
- Text Walls: Huge chunks of text that fill the screen up.
<br>
- Ping Walls: Massive pings. And make sure that the person/people you are pinging agree to the pinging.



<h2>III. MODERATION</h2>
Do not simply ask for staff. It will be given to you when I decide it will be given to you. If you are to apply for staff you will strongly need acceptable experience as well as evidence.
<br>
No creating, modifying, or deleting roles, channels, invites and categories without permission from the owner. The level of moderation here is medium and has a 2FA requirement.
<br>
Do not abuse your moderation abilities. Do not use them to blackmail or dox people, force people into doing something that violates the rules, ban or kick people for no good reason, assign or remove roles from people without a sufficient reason or permission, mass-ping people or roles without a sufficient reason or permission, or violate the rules yourself using your presence as a staff member as an excuse.
<br>
Punishments for misbehavers that are not staff can vary depending on the offense. The minimum amount of time suggested for a manual mute is 1 hour. As the misbehaver commits more offenses, the mute duration is added. The mute duration progression is 1h-2h-4h-6h-12h-1d-3d-7d-14d. After 9 manual mutes, the offender is either kicked or banned. If it is a ban, it is not appealable. Any staff caught trying to make the ban appealable will be demoted.
<br>
No inviting/kicking bots without sufficient permission from the owner. No modifying Carl-bot settings without sufficient permission from the owner.
<br>
Staff receive a temporary demote upon causing an infraction, the duration of the demote dependent on the violation caused. Upon 3 infractions the targeted staff member is permanently demoted and muted for one week.
<br>
However, if the level of the violation caused by the staff is extreme, staff will be immediately banned from the server (as well as rickrolled to set an example).
<br>
If you notice any one of our staff misbehaving, report immediately to superior administration or directly to SciPred.



<h2>IV. GIVEAWAYS</h2>
No begging. If you got re-rolled thats probably because you didnt respond in time, and we dont need your verification on if we host legit or not.
<br>
If you have won a giveaway but the giveaway host is offline, either wait for the host to become online and DM them there and then, or DM them while they're offline and they can give the prize once they are online.
<br>
If the giveaway host is online and you have DM'd them but they have not given the prize, either wait for a response and DM them again, or complain directly to SciPred that you have been scammed.



<h2>Section VII: Loopholes, Bypasses and Fallacies</h2>
You are not allowed to use loopholes, false arguments and the like to escape a designated consequence for breaking a rule. These include:
<br>
- Attribution: "If he did it in another server without getting banned then I can do it in this server."
<br>
- Authority: "Who do you think you are that dare talk to me like that?"
<br>
- Authorization: "One of your staff said I could do it."
<br>
- Bandwagon: "I don't see him following the rules, so I'm doing the same."
<br>
- Blame: "He told me to do it!"
<br>
- Bribery: "If you let me do so I'll give you what you want."
<br>
- Compensation: "You punished me for no apparent reason, so this should make up for it."
<br>
- Contribution: "I helped this server out a lot, so I deserve it."
<br>
- Experimentation: "It's just a test, no harm done."
<br>
- Freedom: "What use is a server that does not grant us freedom?"
<br>
- Hypocrisy: "As if you yourself follow the rules."
<br>
- Idiocy: "I don't understand."
<br>
- Memeing: "I was just joking bro"
<br>
- Privacy: "Clearly this is my business, not yours."
<br>
- Private Interpretation: "According to me, this doesn't count."
<br>
- Public Interpretation: "According to this person/these people, this doesn't count."
<br>
- Regional Placement: "In the place I'm in, this rule doesn't apply."
<br>
- Repetitive Accidents: "Whoops, sorry, I mistyped... whoops, I copypasted the wrong thing... whoops, autocorrect..."
<br>
- Revenge: "You broke the rules in my server, so I'll do the same in yours."
<br>
- Self-Interpretation: "In my defense, it didn't look like it was breaking the rules."
<br>
- Specification: "I'm pretty sure this rule only applies to this certain channel."
<br>
- Superiority: "I'm a staff member, I can do what I want."
<br>
- Time Differentiation: "You're reprimanding the me now rather than the me from earlier. You can't do that."
