<h1>ServerPred Detailed Rules</h1>
<p>This page is a more detailed version of the simplified rules in the ServerPred Discord server.</p>

<h2>I. Introduction</h2>
<p>As a member or moderator, either temporary or permanent, you are required to follow both the Discord Terms of Service as well as the rules of this server. You are not allowed to forgo any of these conditions in any part of the server, may it be verbal, visual, or vocal. Violating any of these rules can and will result in a punishment suiting your cause, albeit your position and ranking as well as your good-willed contributions to the server and its members. You are subjected to follow these conditions for any actions you may do in the server. You may use and communicate in the server as made available to you, not as how you wish to use it nor how you believe other people have told you to use it. You are also obliged to follow Discord's Terms of Service as well as these rules.</p>

<h2>II. Account</h2>
<p>You will be warned or kicked if you are caught having a profile picture, status, about me, user tag, nickname or banner that violates the rules, including:</p>
<details>
	<summary>Discrimination</summary>
	<p>All forms of discrimination are strictly prohibited. This includes discrimination against race, color, gender, age, disabilities, citizenship, religion, political and/or personal beliefs, culture, status and/or profile, parental and/or marriage status, maternity status, intelligence and/or skill, employment status, social media status, superstitions, and game status.</p>
	<p>Examples of discrimination include racism, sexism, antisemitism, nazism, and various branches of communism.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Extreme War Beliefs</summary>
	<p>Ideologies such as nazism and fascism are strictly prohibited.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Sexually Explicit Content</summary>
	<p>Pornography and/or nudity of any sort is strictly prohibited. An image in your profile can be considered sexually explicit if it is a visual depiction of actual or simulated human sex acts, or the unclothed human genitalia, pubic area, anus, buttocks, or female breast that lacks serious literary, scientific, or political value.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Gore</summary>
	<p>Pictures of explicitly shown gore such as uncensored crime scene pictures, cannibalism, scattered organs, and the like are strictly prohibited.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Unwanted Impersonation</summary>
	<p>Identity theft is strictly prohibited. If you are going to mimic the profile and/or behavior of someone else, ask permission from the person you are mimicking. Do not claim to be the person you are impersonating unless you have permission.</p>
</details>

<h2>III. Content</h2>
<details>
	<summary>Language</summary>
	<p>English is the main language of this server. As much as possible, refrain from speaking in the vernacular. If you are to speak, use a translator or ask someone trustworthy to translate your message into English. Be sure that the translation is accurate. (Words that violate the rules that have been mistranslated are appealable unless the mistranslation was intended.)</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Appropriateness</summary>
	<p>Keep stuff in their respective channels.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Sensitivity</summary>
	<p>Refrain from making fun of or talking about religious, suicidal or explicitly political topics.</p>
	<p>No toxicity, harassment, or discrimination.</p>
	<p>No starting flaming arguments or debates that can get out of hand. Keep such arguments in DMs, or in other servers whenever appropriate. Of course, friendly arguments such as mathematical debates are allowed, but not to the point where either side resorts to ad hominem.</p>
	<p>No causing uncontrolled drama, self-pity, pessimism intended to spread to other people or existential crises. Do this privately whenever necessary.</p>
	<p>Strictly no direct NSFW or NSFL content. This includes pornography websites, hentai, gore, psychopathic shock videos, surgery procedures, violent crime and uncensored mutilation. Regardless of the intention, this server is the wrong place for that kind of content.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Swearing</summary>
	<p>Do your best not to swear. Although Carl-bot autowarns people (and when at 3 or more warns mutes them), mutes from swearing are always appealable. Just DM the owner or a staff member that can unmute you. However, note that although swear mutes are always appealable, it does not guarantee that your appeals will be granted.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Attention</summary>
	<p>No spam-pinging people who have no confirmation that they are to be pinged, especially those who do not want to be disturbed. It's best if you decide not to spam-ping them in the first place.</p>
	<p>Respect others as they would respect you. However, this does not mean that you should be toxic if another is being toxic at you. Your best response would be to get help from staff.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Information</summary>
	<p>No manipulating or mismanaging information. Do not try to photoshop certain messages or conversations to ruin someone's reputation or to backstab them.</p>
	<p>Do not try to purposefully misinterpret information to other people.</p>
	<p>No misinforming people into thinking that running a specified harmful command on Command Prompt, Powershell, Git Bash, etc. is safe.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Software</summary>
	<p>No adware, backdoors, DDoS, ransomware, bloatware, trojan horses, viruses, worms, spyware, rootkits, keyloggers, crimeware, RAM scrapers, phishing links, links to third-party driver updaters, grabify links, Visual Basic Script files, Fake Nitro rickroll links, and any other form of malware or dangerous software.</p>
	<p>Strictly no posting videos, images, gifs or files that intentionally crash Discord, or files that harmfully manipulate the Discord GUI or the computers or mobile devices of those using Discord in any way.</p>
	<p>If you are a developer and want people to try out a game or program you are developing, you will have to confirm that the files you are sending are safe. This is to prevent the False Developer Scam from taking over other people's accounts.</p>
</details>

<h2>IV. Privacy</h2>
<details>
	<summary>Personal Information</summary>
	<p>No blackmailing or doxxing members, regardless of the intention or what the victim did.</p>
	<p>Refrain from sharing private information in the server, whether it be yours or someone else's. Things such as addresses, credit card information, birth certificates, driver's licenses, plate numbers, account passwords, Social Security numbers and IDs are not allowed, regardless of how heavily censored or uncensored they may be.</p>
	<p>No sharing links to websites that expose private information such as the aforementioned examples, especially those that contain the information of one or more server members, when the members involved do not want that information shown.</p>
</details>

<h2>V. External Links and Scams</h2>
<details>
	<summary>Free Nitro</summary>
	<p>No Free Nitro scam links. Many of these usually have a single-character error in the link. Always double-check and report scams. If you detect someone scamming people in the form of flooding channels (and sometimes DMs), immediately block them and ask help from staff. If you want to legitimately give away free Nitro, ask a staff member or give the Nitro in private. If you want to give away Nitro in a giveaway, ask a staff member to make the giveaway.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>QR Codes</summary>
	<p>Do not send potentially harmful QR codes or anything that requires you to scan a potentially harmful QR code.</p>
	<p>Refrain from posting QR codes without context.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Harmful Externals</summary>
	<p>Do not send links to YouTube videos, phishing embeds, Reddit threads, Tweets, Discord Content Delivery Network media, Discord servers, Onion links, Instagram photos, TikToks, Google Drive files, Github repositories, Steam games, Minecraft mods, Facebook posts, LinkedIn posts, Pinterest images, Google Play and/or App Store apps, DeviantArt media, Wattpad posts, Snapchat posts, Quora and/or StackExchange questions and answers, Twitch streams, OneDrive files, and the like, if the content explicitly violates the rules.</p>
</details>

<h2>VI. Spam</h2>
<p>Spam must only be done in the spam channel. Forms of spam include:
	<br>
	- General Spam: malvertisement, ad scams, etc.
	<br>
	- Self-Advertisement: repeatedly flooding the server with massive adverts. These include links to other channels, servers, and web pages.
	<br>
	- Ping Walls: Massive pings, usually consisting of different users.
	<br>
	Allowed forms of spam, which can be done only in the spam channel, include:
	<br>
	- Copypasta: repeatedly sending messages with the same content.
	<br>
	- Emoji Spam: mass cluttering of emojis, or using every emoji in one message.
	<br>
	- Single-Letter Alphabetical Chains: The alphabet consists of 26 different letters. The longest single-letter chain formable is 52 letters long (A-Z, A-Z), and the shortest 2 letters (A, A). You cannot form a chain not in the spam channel longer than 2n characters, where n is the number of different characters in the chain. For single-Unicode chains, the longest you can form is 10.
	<br>
	- Differing-Length Chains: These are chains with no particular order of content but are intuitively similar.
	<br>
	- Numerical Sequences: These are chains with a particular mathematical order that altogether make a sequence, such as arithmetic, geometric, harmonic, and Fibonacci sequences.
	<br>
	- Character Increments/Decrements: These are chains where a character or a group of characters is added or removed from the previous message's content.
	<br>
	- Vertical Sentences: Chains that when read from top to bottom or vice versa form a sentence, phrase, or word.
	<br>
	- Random Characters: Chains or messages without any particular order or similarity, especially those that look like you slammed your hands or feet (or sometimes your head) on your keyboard.
	<br>
	- Malbolge: A programming language specifically designed to be almost impossible to use.
	<br>
	- Blanks: these are empty-looking messages that fill up more than half of the entire screen.
	<br>
	- Text Walls: Huge chunks of text that fill the screen up. However, although allowed by default, there is a limit to which a text wall can be considered approved, depending on how many lines the wall measures by height.
</p>

<h2>VII. Moderation</h2>
<p>Do not simply ask for staff. If you are to apply for staff you will strongly need acceptable experience as well as evidence, and you will have to wait until staff applications are open. Do not repeatedly beg superior staff for it.</p>
<p>If you want to be promoted and you are staff, DM the owner about your request. Be serious about it. Do not repeatedly ask the owner about it.</p>
<p>If you want someone else to be promoted or demoted, DM the owner about your request. Do not repeatedly ask the owner about it.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee that you (or someone you want to be promoted) will be promoted after asking the owner about it.</p>
<p>You will not be given Staff Immunity upon promotion. This means that you can be demoted as soon as you are promoted, once you make a violation.</p>
<p>If you want to resign from staff or want to be demoted to a lower level of staff, DM the owner. However, you cannot simply ask to be demoted to trial staff, because that would cause a sort of promote-demote loop. The lowest form of staff you can ask for is normal staff. Do not repeatedly ask the owner about it. Once you make the request, you will not be promoted again unless you have been the highest voted for in a server election.</p>
<p>Anyone caught demoting or promoting staff without the owner's consent or knowledge will be demoted and tempbanned without appeal. Anyone caught performing false mutes, warns, kicks or bans will be demoted and/or tempbanned.</p>
<p>No creating, modifying, or deleting roles, channels, invites and categories without permission from the owner. No modifiying, adding or removing slowmode from a channel without the owner's consent. The level of moderation here is medium and has a 2FA requirement. You will be instantly demoted and permabanned without appeal if you are caught to have intentionally deleted an important server role. If accidental, you will be demoted and kicked.</p>
<p>Do not abuse your moderation abilities. Do not use them to blackmail or dox people, force people into doing something that violates the rules, ban or kick people for no good reason, assign or remove roles from people without a sufficient reason or permission, mass-ping people or roles without a sufficient reason or permission, or violate the rules yourself using your presence as a staff member as an excuse. No creating emojis that violate the rules or remove already-existing emojis that you did not create.</p>
<p>Do not timeout, mute, kick, ban, or perform any moderation commands on a person because of personal preference. Do not make up your own rules for the server. If you wish for a rule to be added, edited or removed, DM the owner.</p>
<p>Be cautious for any accounts that are younger than 14 days old. If you detect any suspicious activity from the account, tempban or permaban the account immediately depending on the activities. Most of these accounts are usually alts, Dank Memer currency thieves, raid accounts, and the like. If someone joins, attempts to steal Dank Memer currency and then leaves, permaban them immediately without chance of appeal. If you see someone Nitro scam raiding or racist-advertising, permaban the user without hesitation or remorse. Delete all the user has said in the server within 24 hours.</p>
<p>If someone wants to legitimately give away Nitro, use the alias "FN courtesy of" in the giveaway instead of "Free Nitro, courtesy of" to prevent an accidental mute. If the giveaway ends and the person does not confirm giving the Nitro to the winner, tempban the person for 7 days.</p>
<p>No inviting/kicking bots without sufficient permission from the owner. No modifying Carl-bot settings without sufficient permission from the owner. No banning or kicking because of personal preference. Anyone caught trying to appeal a ban without the owner's knowledge will be demoted unless the reason is legitimate and has evidence to back up the appeal. Anyone caught trying to delete evidence for a ban will be demoted.</p>
<p>Staff receive a temporary demote upon causing an infraction, with the duration of the demote dependent on the violation caused. Upon 3 or more infractions the targeted staff member is permanently demoted. Infractions are not appealable unless it is accidental, such as when swearing.
However, if the level of the violation caused by the staff is extreme, staff will be immediately permabanned from the server.</p>
<p>If you are caught ignoring a misbehaver and taking no actions even though you are well aware and are visibly active in the channels the person is misbehaving in, you will be warned or demoted. If you are joining the misbehaver, you will be warned and demoted.</p>
<p>If you notice any one of our staff misbehaving, report immediately to superior administration or directly to SciPred. False reports will be warned.</p>

<h2>VIII. Giveaways</h2>
<p>No begging. If you got re-rolled, that's probably because you didn't respond in time, and we don't need your verification on if we host legit or not. If a giveaway does not have any specified response time then you should claim it as soon as possible. If you do not claim it within 3 days or so, the giveaway will be re-rolled.</p>
<p>If you have won a giveaway but the giveaway host is offline, either wait for the host to become online and DM them there and then, or DM them while they're offline and they can give the prize once they are online.</p>
<p>If the giveaway host is online and you have DM'd them but they have not given the prize, or if the giveaway host has a response time but is not online during the set response time, either wait for a response and DM them again, or complain directly to SciPred that you have been scammed. It is not suggested that you wait any longer than 24 hours upon winning the giveaway. False complaints will be warned.</p>
<p>Do not erase giveaways that have already started and/or have not finished. Wait for the giveaway to finish and for the prizes to be given before deleting the giveaway.</p>

<h2>IX. Loopholes, Bypasses and Fallacies</h2>
<p>You are not allowed to use loopholes, false arguments and the like to escape a designated consequence for breaking a rule. These include:
	<br>
	- Ad Antiquitatem: "It's right because it's always been done that way."
	<br>
	- Ad Hominem: "But he's bad because he did that, so it's only right I do this."
	<br>
	- Ad Misericordiam: "But please, let me do this just once! I'm so poor and I've never done this before!"
	<br>
	- Ad Populum: "According to the majority of people, this doesn't count."
	<br>
	- Ad Verecundiam: "According to this person, who is authoritative, this doesn't count."
	<br>
	- Attribution: "If he did it in another server without getting banned then I can do it in this server."
	<br>
	- Authority: "Who do you think you are that dare talk to me like that?"
	<br>
	- Authorization: "One of your staff said I could do it."
	<br>
	- Bandwagon: "I don't see him following the rules, so I'm doing the same."
	<br>
	- Blame: "He told me to do it!"
	<br>
	- Bribery: "If you let me do so I'll give you what you want."
	<br>
	- Compensation: "You punished me for no apparent reason, so this should make up for it."
	<br>
	- Contribution: "I helped this server out a lot, so I deserve it."
	<br>
	- Equivocation: "This is a Discord server. X is a Discord server. Therefore this server and X are the same."
	<br>
	- Experimentation: "It's just a test, no harm done."
	<br>
	- False Idiocy: "I don't understand."
	<br>
	- Freedom: "What use is a server that does not grant us freedom?"
	<br>
	- Hypocrisy: "As if you yourself follow the rules."
	<br>
	- Lacuna: "There isn't any rule that specifically states that this is a violation."
	<br>
	- Memeing: "I was just joking bro"
	<br>
	- Privacy: "Clearly this is my business, not yours."
	<br>
	- Private Interpretation: "According to me, this doesn't count."
	<br>
	- Regional Placement: "In the place I'm in, this rule doesn't apply."
	<br>
	- Repetitive Accidents: "Whoops, sorry, I mistyped... whoops, I copypasted the wrong thing... whoops, autocorrect..."
	<br>
	- Revenge: "You broke the rules in my server, so I'll do the same in yours."
	<br>
	- Self-Interpretation: "In my defense, it didn't look like it was breaking the rules."
	<br>
	- Specification: "I'm pretty sure this rule only applies to this certain channel."
	<br>
	- Superiority: "I'm a staff member, I can do what I want."
	<br>
	- Time Differentiation: "You're reprimanding the me now rather than the me from earlier. You can't do that."
	<br>
	- Tu quoque: "You did that, so I can do that too!"
</p>

<h2>X. Common Examples</h2>
<details>
	<summary>Example 1</summary>
	<p>Situation: A member has a swastika on their profile picture.</p>
	<p>Legality: The user is violating the rules. Although the swastika is an ancient religious symbol, it is also a sign of nazism.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Example 2</summary>
	<p>Situation: A moderator has banned a member without giving reason for the ban.</p>
	<p>Legality: The user is violating the rules. Bans without reasons given are against the rules.</p>
</details>
<details>
	<summary>Example 3</summary>
	<p>Situation: A member is accusing a moderator of a rule violation. The moderator is found to be guilty, but the member is also found to be guilty of the same violation.</p>

</details>
<details>
	<summary>Example 6</summary>
	<p>Situation: A member is claiming to be SciPred and is impersonating him and mimicking his every move. He decries the actual SciPred for fraud and identity theft.</p>

</details>
<details>
	<summary>Example 7</summary>
	<p>Situation: A member has sent the credit card information of another member. He claims that the card is unusable because it has been disabled, and this is proven to be true.</p>

</details>
<details>
	<summary>Example 8</summary>
	<p>Situation: A member is using a hentai profile picture. The face and upper abdomen is seen but the body is not.</p>
	<p>Legality: The member is violating the rules. The image is a depiction of simulated human sex and counts as sexually explicit content.</p>
</details>
<details>

</details>
<details>
	<summary>Example 10</summary>
	<p>Situation: A member is speaking in French but is capable of speaking in English. The member ignores suggestions and warnings to talk in foreign language.</p>
	<p>Legality: The member is violating the rules. English is the only acceptable language in the server.</p>
